Proposal for Project Part 1
How should the faculty evaluate projects?
The Faculty should have the ability to comment all of the projects to suggest improvements. 
However, the normal Faculty which is not an advisor can not approve the projects.
Approving the project is the work of another faculty role called Advisor Faculty.
This role can approve and send personal comments to the group they are an advisor 
for.
